This project is for the subject of Front End 3, of the certified tech developer career of the program launched by Digital House, Globant and Mercado Libre.
In this opportunity I created a shopping cart using functional components.

It is desired to implement a system of shopping cart.This must meet the following requirements:
- **Stock counter:** The products must have a stock counter. That starts with the initial stock and must decrease as the product is purchased.
- **Product counter:** When a product is purchased, the stock counter decreases and the product counter increases.
